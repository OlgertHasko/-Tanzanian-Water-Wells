## Overview

Tanzania is an East African country with about 59,678,000 in population (2021 est.), and located just south of the Equator. Despite their rapidly expanding tourism market and being high in agriculture cultivation, Tanzania is a developing country that has struggles with providing clean water to its entire population. There are many water points already established in the country, but some are in need of repair while others have failed altogether.

## Business Problem

A local NGO is focused on finding and replacing water wells that need repair. Our classification model is being used to predict which wells may need repair using various information such as when each well was installed, who funded the project, population around each well and etc. 

**Our goal is to provide answers to questions such as:**<br />
What companies or organizations are more effective at maintaining their wells?<br />
What factors influence whether a well may be broken or needing repair?<br />
Could we be able to roughly guess how long a well will last before breaking or needing repair?<br />
Is there a correaltion between the population and functional wells?

## Data

We are using the Tanzanian Water Wells data set hosted by DrivenData and a part of the active competition [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). We were provided with 3 datasets in total. 

This is a basic overview of each dataset:<br />
Training set values: 59,400 observations, 40 variables<br />
Test set: 14,850 observations, 40 variables<br />
Training set labels: 59,400 observations; which contains our target variable which is 'status_group'<br />

'status_group' has the following well categories of 'Functional', 'Functional needs repair', and 'Nonfunctional'

## Methods

We are doing an interative classification analysis on the functionality of water wells in Tanzania. We made multiple alterations in the process while comparing the improvements for each model built. We started off first with Dummy model to get our baseline predictions. Then we moved on to a Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree, Random Forest, a Gradient Boosted model, and finally we catboosted to achieve our final results.
